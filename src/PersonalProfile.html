        <p>In addition to my passion for technology and software engineering, I believe in maintaining a well-rounded lifestyle. During my free time, I indulge in various hobbies that allow me to unwind, explore different interests, and foster personal growth. One of my favorite hobbies is reading. I find solace in the pages of books, ranging from fiction to non-fiction, as they transport me to new worlds and broaden my perspective. Additionally, I enjoy staying active through physical activities such as hiking and playing sports like basketball or soccer. These activities not only keep me fit but also provide a refreshing break from the digital realm. Furthermore, I have a creative side that I nurture through pursuits such as photography and graphic design. Capturing moments behind the lens or creating visually appealing designs allows me to express my artistic flair. Overall, balancing my technological pursuits with a diverse range of hobbies helps me maintain a well-rounded and fulfilling lifestyle.</p>

        <h3 class="ms-1 fs-1 fw-bolder">&#47; Plans</h3>
        <p>I am thrilled to share my plans to visit two incredible destinations: Santorini, Greece, and Paris, France. These two places offer unique experiences and cultural wonders that I am eager to explore.

            Firstly, Santorini, Greece, has captured my imagination with its breathtaking beauty and stunning landscapes. I plan to immerse myself in the charm of the island, with its iconic white-washed buildings perched on cliffs overlooking the azure Aegean Sea. Exploring the picturesque villages of Oia and Fira, I look forward to wandering through the narrow cobblestone streets, discovering hidden gems, and capturing unforgettable sunsets. I am also excited to indulge in the local cuisine, savoring traditional Greek dishes while enjoying the warm hospitality of the islanders.
            
            After soaking in the tranquility of Santorini, my journey will take me to the enchanting city of Paris, France. Known as the "City of Lights," Paris is renowned for its rich history, art, and iconic landmarks. I plan to marvel at the architectural marvels of the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. Exploring the charming neighborhoods of Montmartre and Le Marais, I hope to experience the vibrant street culture, visit quaint cafes, and immerse myself in the Parisian way of life. Of course, no visit to Paris would be complete without indulging in delectable pastries, sipping coffee in charming bistros, and strolling along the Seine River.
            
            Both destinations offer a blend of natural beauty, cultural heritage, and unique experiences that I am eagerly looking forward to. From the sun-drenched beaches of Santorini to the artistic grandeur of Paris, I am excited to embark on this journey of discovery, immersing myself in the beauty, history, and vibrant atmosphere of these captivating destinations.
